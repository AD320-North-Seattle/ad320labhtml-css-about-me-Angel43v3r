<!-- Comments (shown in green in many editors) are ignored by the browser. They start with the text “less-than sign, exclamation mark, two hyphens” and end with “two hyphens, greater-than sign”. They’re typically used to leave notes or instructions for developers. In this lesson, I’ll use them to share information about the document. -->

    <!--What are HTML Elements?-->

    <div class="wrapper">
      <!-- The <div> tag is a general container that can hold almost any content. It’s commonly used to wrap elements together to help organize a page into sections. -->

      <!-- The class attribute groups elements under a shared name so you can style or select them together. Typically used for multiple elements that share the same class. -->
      <div class="card" id="rose_card">
        <!-- The id attribute is a unique identifier for an element. It can be used to select that element, but unlike a class it should be unique to that single tag. -->
        <h3>Rose The Cat</h3>
        <!-- <h> (h1-h6) tags are header tags used to mark and identify sections of a page. They also help screen readers recognize the start of related content. -->
        <img src="rose.png" alt="rose the cat" />
        <!-- i<img> tags are for images, src points to the source or where the image is located and the alt appears if there's an issue with the image -->
        <h4>Bio:</h4>
        <p>
          <!-- The <p> tag defines a paragraph, used for longer blocks of text. -->

          Rose was surrendered to PAWs at the early age of 1 year and stayed
          there for 5 years until he was adopted by his current owner. He is a
          sweet 13-year-old indoor cat with the energy of a kitten. While not a
          traditionally trained Software Developer, Rose excels at full-stack
          development. He's always willing to perform a code review and give
          honest, actionable feedback. Sadly, his feedback is typically ignored
          as he is a Cat, and no one can understand what he's saying.

        <h4>Hobbies</h4>
        <ul>
          <!-- The <ul> and <li> tags create a list. 
<ul> defines an unordered (bulleted) list and <li> defines each list item.
